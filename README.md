# Fitness Friend

I created a fitness tracking application that was built with Express, Node.js and has a MongoDB database. You can enter in your workouts and choose if the workout is a cardio or a resistance exercises. The application then allows you to see all of the information regarding your combined workouts and well ad clean, slick charts showing you your workout progress.
